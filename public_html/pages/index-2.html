<!-- Lists. There are ordered and unorderd lists.  Unorderd lists use the <ul> open tag and the closing </ul> tag. An orderd list is created with the open <ol> tag anc closed with the </ol> tag. Unorderd lists are more popular for websites but the orderd lists have their place too so it's good to know both. -->
