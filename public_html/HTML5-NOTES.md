1. The ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags). Currently all modern browsers will recognize the <!DOCTYPE html> to be what ever the latest version of HTML is being used and render it as such. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

2. Browsers read in a top down manor. It needs to see the Doctype Declaration ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` first, and then move on down through the rest of the code so it must be at the top of the document.

3. The **HTML** open ```<html>``` and closing ```</html>``` tags and the items inside are called an **Element** but they are not considered a Section of the webpage.

4. The **Head Element** (<head> </head> ), is our first *real* Section. Inside the **Head Element** will be items that are not visible in the markup of the document. They include the **title** tag, any **meta tags**, and **JavaScript Refences**.

5. The body section is the primary section of the web page.

6. The h1 element is also a section of the webpage. It is the title of our first body section.
