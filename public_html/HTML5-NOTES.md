1. Browsers read in a top down manor. It will see the Doctype Declaration (<!doctype html>)first, and then move on so it must be at the top of the document.

2. The HTML open (<html>) and closing (</html>) tags and the items inside are called an element but they are not considered a section.

3. The Head Element (<head> </head> ), is our first real Section. The title tag, any meta tags, and JavaScript Refences are all located inside the Head Element.

4. The body section is the primary section of the web page.

5. The h1 element is also a section of the webpage. It is the title of our first body section.
