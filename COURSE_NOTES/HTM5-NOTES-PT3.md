# W3School-0005 Video Notes Pt 3


## INTRODUCTION

These notes will provide the information compiled and deemed helpful in understanding the information given in both the HTML video course provided in the README.md, and from the HTML online tutorials from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/).

For this project, we will be using GitHub's version control to document the progress of the test environment that is needed, and which documents the progress of our understanding of HTML5 custom code development and design process. It will be a living document that will be added to and redesigned on-the-fly by your instructors in order to be a more up to date knowledgebase of the latest HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript languages and their standards.

We will start with information and notes from both the Video Tutorials referenced in the README.md for the project and it is recommended that you watch the video referenced in this document as well as reading from the [W3Schools.com's](https://www.w3schools.com/) wonderful HTML Tutorial Course and online reference documents, as well as noting the information in this document.
