## INTRODUCTION

These notes will provide the information compiled and deemed helpful in understanding the information given in both the [HTML Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr6-GrHUlVf_ZNmuQSXdS197Oyr1L9sPB) listed in the project's README.md, and from the HTML online tutorials from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/).



### HTML Attribute Reference

A complete list of all attributes for each HTML element, is listed in W3School's: [HTML Attribute Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp).


### HTML Headings

HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
 * Example
 ```html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en-US">

 <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Test Formatting Index</title>
 </head>

 <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
 </body>

 </html>
 ```

#### More on HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
 * Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
 * Headings Are Important
 	* Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
 	* Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
	* `<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.
	* Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
 * Bigger Headings
 	* Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the `style` attribute, using the CSS `font-size` property:
	```html
	<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
	```
