# The W3School-0005 Project

## Introduction

Welcome to [Omni-Solutions Tech's](https://www.omni-solutions-tech.com/) **Beginning to Advanced HTML Development Training and Learning Project**:

**"W3School-0005"**.

This Project's [README.md](https://github.com/AdamRj-765/W3School-0005/blob/master/README.md) serves as an informative introductory document which outlines the project's:

* [Mission](#mission)
* [Audience](#audience)
* [Resource Requirements](#resource-requirements)
* [Project's File System Tree](#-development-file-system-tree)
* [Web Development File System](#-web-development-file-system)
* [List of Sources](#list-of-sources)


### Mission

This project will not only endeavor to provide **Basic to Advanced Web Development** training in **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES9 or ECMAScript 2018)** through it's comprehensive **HTML5-NOTES-PT-#.md** files, and it's examples of core HTML development file system examples, but will also show trainees/coders how to implement an effective collaborative development environment using GitHub's **Version Control System** or *"Versioning"* process as it pertains to web development. In this case, the collaborative environment of [GitHub's](https://github.com/) *online* **Version Control System** is ideal for our project needs, and this project attempts to demonstrate how to use it to document the progress of our understanding of HTML5 and it's development processes.

* Project **W3School-0005** is the first in a series of internal *Web Development Coursework Projects* which offer an education in W3C compliant *in-house* training familiarity with **Basic to Advanced Web Development**.

* Our project's name (**"W3School-0005"**) infers that the primary source of our coursework will be from the very reliable and up-to-date [W3Schools Online HTML Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp), it's reference documentation, and the [HTML Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr6-GrHUlVf_ZNmuQSXdS197Oyr1L9sPB) YouTube Video Playlist.

* It is worth noting that [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://w3schools.com) directly mirrors the recommendations of the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) open standards, which is a requirement for all of our HTML5 Development Policies and is a definitive guidance and standard for advanced web developers around the world as *the* go-to organization for web development's technical standards.

* The project's **HTML5-NOTES-PT-#.md** markdown files located in the [COURSE_NOTES](https://github.com/AdamRj-765/W3School-0005/tree/master/COURSE_NOTES) folder will provide the bulk of the information as a living set of documents that serve as a more complete reference than either of our two main sources listed above.

* The code and versioning training process will be addressed in separate documentation from the HTML developer notes and are also located in the [COURSE_NOTES](https://github.com/AdamRj-765/W3School-0005/tree/master/COURSE_NOTES) folder of the project. They will have the file name format of **GITHUB-NOTES-PT-#.md**, and will demonstrate our recommended use of a collaborative versioning web development process.

* The files located in the Web Development Test Environment are designed to be kept in a vanilla state (as they are now) so that a student learning from this project can clone this repository, and edit the HTML files inside the `public_html` folder located in his/her own local filesystem in order to test the processes outlined in the `HTML5-NOTES` documents but not to merge their changes to the branch in **ANY WAY**.


### Audience

This project is designed for [Omni-Solutions Tech](https://www.omni-solutions-tech.com/) employees that are learning *Beginning to Advanced HTML Web Development*, and for trainees of the **Web Development Team**. For them, the project will provide the information and a starting dev environment needed to complete the goals of the project's design requirements.

* As of this moment the project is ready to be utilized for your advancement and education in the true spirit of HTML development at [Omni-Solutions Tech](https://www.omni-solutions-tech.com/), and it's many benefits in the business web application realm of knowledge.

* For any public viewers or followers of the project/repository there will be a gap of information as to how this project will implement GitHub **version control** for development per our internal training.





### Resource Requirements

* The **Version Control System Application** we will be using to manage our local repositories for this course is called **GitHub Desktop** (latest version) available free for download **[here](https://desktop.github.com/)**.
* The recommended text editor we will be using is called **Atom** latest version which is available **[here](https://atom.io/)**.

* Please download these two applications for your development system when you are ready to begin the project.

* You will also need to create a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account and have access to your profile before beginning the project goals so you may clone the repository and use the development files.

* As mentioned above this project also strives to provide an example of how to track HTML development changes to a website, the folder structures involved, and the manor in which we at **Omni-Solutions Tech** prefer to use a **Version Control System** to track changes and advances in a collaborative website development project.

### Web Development File System

### Project Requirements

The notes located in the [COURSE_NOTES](https://github.com/AdamRj-765/W3School-0005/tree/master/COURSE_NOTES) folder as well as our HTML test environment's site files located in the [public_html](https://github.com/AdamRj-765/W3School-0005/tree/master/public_html) folder are designed to help you complete the course.

* This process of versioning our progress in the test environment is essential for us to see changes to the initial dev environments therefore the test environment should **NOT** be merged by any students.

* However, showing the progress of the web page from a beginning basic *bare-bones* index page and site files can be tracked by students if the Project Admins keep **ONLY** the branches that are labeled as `dev-...`so that the project can be observed in it's progress by accessing those branches instead of the master branch.

* Those branches deal with the changes in the coding of the page and should be kept for reference because they are needed to document the progress of our understanding of HTML5 custom code development and design process through the NOTES and the site files. Please do **NOT** merge or delete them.


We will start with information and notes taken from both the Video Tutorials for this project, and the [W3Schools.com's Beginner's HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) located here: `https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp`. However, there is no need to view either of these sources as the project requirements will start with the notes given in the **COURSE_NOTES** folder (see below).


Let's get started shall we?  Please click on this link to the first [HTML5-NOTES-PT-1.md](https://github.com/AdamRj-765/W3School-0005/blob/master/COURSE_NOTES/HTML5-NOTES-PT-1.md) after you have completed downloading and installing the required development applications listed in the [Resource Requirements](#resource-requirements) section of this page.
