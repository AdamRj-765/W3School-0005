# The W3School-0005 Project

## Introduction

Hello, and Welcome to this Project's [README](https://github.com/AdamRj-765/W3School-0005/blob/master/README.md) for [Omni-Solutions Tech's](https://www.omni-solutions-tech.com/) Collaborative GitHub **Web Development** Team HTML Learning Project: **"W3School-0005"**. It is the introductory document that will outline this project's [Audience](#audience), it's [Mission](#mission), it's [Resources Requirements](#resource-requirements), a [Graphical Map of the Development File System Tree](#graphical-map-of-the-development-file-system-tree), the locations of online information and links to working notes, and finally a glossary of links that will be used to complete the objectives of the project's goals.

### Audience

For any public viewers or followers of the project/repository there will be a gap of information as to what this project is for and why version control is being used for documents and development for training, but for members of the Omni-Solutions Tech **Web Development Team** , the project will provide the exact information that is needed per the information the team has been given for this project. As of this moment the project is ready to be utilized for your advancement and education in the true spirit of HTML development at [Omni-Solutions Tech](https://www.omni-solutions-tech.com/) and it's many benefits in the business web application realm of knowledge. Let's get started shall we?

### Mission

Project **W3School-0005** is the first in a series of our internal flagship *Web Development Coursework Projects* and an education program with the singular vision to provide an in-house training and familiarity with **Basic to Advanced Web Development and Design**.
* This project will not only provide the training in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript development, but will also show trainees/coders how to implement an effective collaborative development environment using GitHub's **Version Control System** or **Versioning** development system.

* In this case, the collaborative **Version Control System** environment is ideal for our project needs and we wish to thank [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and it's community and developers for providing the platform for us to do this very essential and critical work.

### Resource Requirements

Our project's name (**"W3School-0005"**) attempts to infer that the source of our **Basic Web Development** coursework will be borrowed from the very reliable, and up-to-date [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://w3schools.com) website, specifically their **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**(ES9 or ECMAScript 2018) Tutorial Suites and Reference documentation.

* It is worth noting that [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://w3schools.com) directly mirrors the recommendations of the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) open standards, which is a requirement for our HTML5 Development Policy and is a definitive guidance for beginner to advanced web developers around the world as *the* go-to organization for web development's technical standards.

* The **Version Control System** we will be using to manage our local repositories for this course is called **GitHub Desktop** (latest version) available [here](https://desktop.github.com/), and the recommended text editor we will be using is called **Atom** latest version which is available [here](https://atom.io/). Please download these two applications for your development system when you are ready to begin the project. You will also need to create a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account and have access to your profile before beginning the project goals.

The code and versioning training process will take the student through the steps of creating code in the versioning test environment but not in the Version Control processes themselves because that is covered in a different training process where the repository creation and control of the version will be the focus.

This project focuses on providing an example of how to track HTML development changes to Markup Documents in a website, the folder structures involved and the correct way to use a version control system to track those changes and advances.


### Graphical Map of the Development File System Tree
Below you will fine the a-typical file structure of our website that is to be developed:
