# W3School-0005


Hello and Welcome to the Project README for [Omni-Solutions Tech](https://www.omni-solutions-tech.com/)'s GitHub Collaborative Web Development Team project: **"W3School-0005"**. It is the introductory document that will outline the mission of the project and provide a short informative brief of the project's mission goals, it's requirements to participate, a graphical map or schematic of the development filesystem structure, the locations of online working notes, and a glossary of links that will be used to complete the objectives of the project's goals.

For any public viewers or followers of the project/repository there will be a gap of information as to why this repository is public, but for members of the Omni-Solutions team, the project will appear just as has been explained and ready to be utilized for your advancement and education in the true spirit of development and it's many benefits in the business application realm of knowledge. Let's get started shall we?

### W3School-0005
W3School-0005 is the first in a series of our internal flagship *Web Development Coursework Projects* and an education program with the singular mission to provide in-house training and familiarity with **Basic to Advanced Web Development and Design**. This project will not only provide the training in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript development, but will also show trainees how to implement an effective collaborative development environment using GitHub's **Version Control System** or **Versioning** development system.

In this case, the collaborative **Version Control System** environment is ideal for our project needs and we wish to thank GitHub.com and it's developers for providing the platform for us to do this very essential and critical work.

Our project's name (**"W3School-0005"**) attempts to infer that the source of our **Basic Web Development** coursework will be borrowed from the very reliable, and up-to-date [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://w3schools.com) website, specifically their HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript(ES9 or ECMAScript 2018) tutorial suites and reference documentation.

It is worth noting that [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://w3schools.com) directly mirrors the recommendations of the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) open standards, which is a requirement for our development policy and a definitive guidance for developers around the world as *the* go-to organization for web development's technical standards.



The **Version Control Application** we will be using to manage our local repositories for this course is called **GitHub Desktop v2.7.2** and is available [here](https://desktop.github.com/), and the recommended text editor we will be using is called **Atom 1.56.0** which is available [here](https://atom.io/). Please download these two applications for your development system when you are ready to begin the project. You will also need to create a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account and have access to your profile before beginning the project goals.

The code and versioning training process will take the student through the steps of creating code in the versioning test environment but not in the Version Control processes themselves because that is covered in a different training process where the repository creation and control of the version will be the focus.

This project focuses on providing an example of how to track HTML development changes to Markup Documents in a website, the folder structures involved and the correct way to use a version control system to track those changes and advances.

Below you will fine the a-typical file structure of our website that is to be developed:
