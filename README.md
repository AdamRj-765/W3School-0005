# W3School-0005

This project titled **"W3School-0005"** is **Omni-Solutions Tech's** endeavor to teach in-house HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript development using a version control system. In this case the Version Control System is GitHub using the Atom MS Windows 10 application and the project's name is also the GitHub repository's name.

The code and versioning training process will take the student through the steps of creating code in the versioning test environment but not in the Version Control processes themselves because that is covered in a different training process where the repository creation and control of the version will be the focus.

This project focuses on providing an example of how to track HTML development changes to Markup Documents in a website, the folder structures involved and the correct way to use a version control system to track those changes and advances.

Below you will fine the a-typical file structure of our website that is to be developed:
(Note: This structure will be edited as the project progresses)

```
W3School-0005/
├── .git/
├── public_html/
├── README.md
└── LICENSE.md
```

This is the current file structure of the project.
